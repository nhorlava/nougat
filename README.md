This is the fork of the official repository for Nougat, the academic document PDF parser that understands LaTeX math and tables.

<b> This fork was modified as part of a collaborative project I am contributing to as an employee of the Max Planck Computing and Data Facility (MPCDF). The project involves the following organizations:</b>

/> Max Planck Computing and Data Facility (MPCDF) 
- Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods


<b> Key changes: </b>
- for pages where the original "nougat" tool produced "[MISSING_PAGE_*]" error, simpler OCR methods (e.g. `pytesseract` tool)  were used to recognize text.
- additionally, the repo was containerized using "apptainer". The recipe is located at `container/apptainer/nougat.def`

<b> Example of running: </b>
`apptainer exec $path_to_container nougat path/to/directory -o output_directory --batchsize 1`


## Install

From repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/nhorlava/nougat.git
cd nougat
apptainer build --fakeroot nougat.sif container/apptainer/nougat.def
```


### Get prediction for a PDF
#### CLI

To get predictions for a PDF run

```
$ nougat path/to/file.pdf -o output_directory
```

A path to a directory or to a file where each line is a path to a PDF can also be passed as a positional argument

```
$ nougat path/to/directory -o output_directory
```

```
usage: nougat [-h] [--batchsize BATCHSIZE] [--checkpoint CHECKPOINT] [--model MODEL] [--out OUT]
              [--recompute] [--markdown] [--no-skipping] pdf [pdf ...]

positional arguments:
  pdf                   PDF(s) to process.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --batchsize BATCHSIZE, -b BATCHSIZE
                        Batch size to use.
  --checkpoint CHECKPOINT, -c CHECKPOINT
                        Path to checkpoint directory.
  --model MODEL_TAG, -m MODEL_TAG
                        Model tag to use.
  --out OUT, -o OUT     Output directory.
  --recompute           Recompute already computed PDF, discarding previous predictions.
  --full-precision      Use float32 instead of bfloat16. Can speed up CPU conversion for some setups.
  --no-markdown         Do not add postprocessing step for markdown compatibility.
  --markdown            Add postprocessing step for markdown compatibility (default).
  --no-skipping         Don't apply failure detection heuristic.
  --pages PAGES, -p PAGES
                        Provide page numbers like '1-4,7' for pages 1 through 4 and page 7. Only works for single PDFs.
```

The default model tag is `0.1.0-small`. If you want to use the base model, use `0.1.0-base`.
```
$ nougat path/to/file.pdf -o output_directory -m 0.1.0-base
```

In the output directory every PDF will be saved as a `.mmd` file, the lightweight markup language, mostly compatible with [Mathpix Markdown](https://github.com/Mathpix/mathpix-markdown-it) (we make use of the LaTeX tables).

> Note: On some devices the failure detection heuristic is not working properly. If you experience a lot of `[MISSING_PAGE]` responses, try to run with the `--no-skipping` flag.
